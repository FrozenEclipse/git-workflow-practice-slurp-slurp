### What I find interesting
It is interesting for me to see a direct comparison between computer science and software engineering. After reading the article, I find computer science more theoretical than I have experienced as a major. As described, computer scientists do not necessarily need to be good at coding - their study can be very abstract, focusing on fundamental philosophies and mathematical principles. Of course, professional research would be more concentrated, but it is still much more abstract than things in my undergraduate studies, such as web development and data management. In the meantime, I find software engineering more comprehensive than I imagined. While I understood it to be a practical field, it is interesting for me to learn that coding, or building the software,  is not the only or that big of a part in it. Instead, testing codes, deploying codes, and even teamwork are all parts of software engineering. The end goal is to deliver a useful and functional product to the client, which is essential in the industry.
